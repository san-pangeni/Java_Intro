Hey there! This is just a quick rundown of 13 Java exercises I recently tackled. The main idea was to get some hands-on practice with arrays and making my own methods.

I. Playing Around with Arrays:

First off, I dove into arrays, using both numbers (int) and text (String). Hereâ€™s what I did:

Grabbing Array Ends: I figured out how to get the first (array[0]) and last (array[array.length - 1]) items in an array without hardcoding the last index. This worked even when I tried it on arrays of different sizes, like when I subtracted the first from the last item in a couple of integer arrays.

Looping for Calcs: I used loops to go through arrays and do some math:

Found the average number in an ages array.

Got the average length of names in a names array.

Added up all the numbers in a nameLengths array.

Making New Array Data: I made a new array called nameLengths by going through my names array and saving how long each name was.

Joining Strings: I took all the names in the names array and stuck them together into one big string with spaces in between. StringBuilder was super handy for this so it didn't slow things down.

II. Building My Own Methods:

Next, I started making my own reusable bits of code (static methods). This was all about figuring out how to set them up with inputs (parameters) and outputs (return types):

Text Tricks:

Made a method to repeat a string a certain number of times (like "Hi" 3 times becomes "HiHiHi").

Another one to stick a first and last name together to make a full name.

Number Crunching:

A method to get the average of a bunch of double (decimal) numbers in an array.

True/False Logic:

One to check if the sum of numbers in an array was over 100.

Another to see if the average of one double array was bigger than another.

A fun one called willBuyDrink that only says "true" if it's hot out AND I have more than $10.50.

My Own Little Problem Solver:

I even made a custom method, isNumberEven, just to check if a number is even. It was a good way to practice applying logic to something new.

III. So, What's the Gist?

Basically, these 13 exercises were a great way to get comfortable with some Java basics. I got a good handle on working with arrays (grabbing stuff, looping through them) and setting up my own methods to keep code neat and tidy. It was a good mix of different data types and thinking through different kinds of problems.
